---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR CLAUDE CODE

### Immediate Goal: Fetch Real-Time Pricing

**What to Build:**
A Python script that:
1. Authenticates with Amadeus API using provided credentials
2. Reads the 42 destinations from CLT_Same_Day_Trips_UPDATED.xlsx
3. For each destination, searches for round-trip flights matching:
   - Outbound: Early morning departure (5am-9am)
   - Return: Evening arrival (3pm-7pm)
   - Same day travel
4. Extracts pricing data for each route
5. Saves results to a new Excel file with:
   - Real flight prices (instead of estimates)
   - Multiple date options (next 7, 14, 30 days)
   - Cheapest date for each route
   - Price per hour at destination
   - Updated value rankings

### Sample API Call Structure:

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# 1. Authenticate
auth_url = "https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token"
auth_data = {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "zDYWXqUHNcmVPjvHVxBeTLK8pZGZ8KbI",
    "client_secret": "QcuIX7JOc4G0AOdc"
}
auth_response = requests.post(auth_url, data=auth_data)
access_token = auth_response.json()['access_token']

# 2. Search for flights (example: CLT to ATL)
search_url = "https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}

# For same-day round trip, you'll need to make separate calls for:
# - Outbound flights (morning departure)
# - Return flights (evening return)
# Then match them to calculate total cost and ground time

params = {
    "originLocationCode": "CLT",
    "destinationLocationCode": "ATL",
    "departureDate": "2025-11-01",  # Use dates 7+ days out
    "adults": 1,
    "max": 10  # Get multiple options
}

response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)
flights = response.json()
```

### Advanced Features to Add:

1. **Price History Tracking**
   - Store prices in database or CSV
   - Track price changes over time
   - Identify pricing trends

2. **Optimal Date Finder**
   - Search multiple dates
   - Find cheapest days to travel
   - Identify price drops

3. **Car Rental Integration**
   - Add Turo/rental car pricing
   - Calculate true total trip cost
   - Compare rental vs rideshare options

4. **Alert System**
   - Monitor specific routes
   - Send alerts when prices drop below threshold
   - Best deal notifications

## üí° PRICING ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY (Current System)

Since we couldn't access real APIs from claude.ai, we used estimates based on:

### Flight Pricing:
- **Regional routes (<90 min):** $95-125
  - Based on typical short-haul pricing
  - CLT regional jet routes
  
- **Mid-range routes (90-120 min):** $130-180
  - Mainline jet service
  - Hub-to-hub competitive routes
  
- **Longer routes (120+ min):** $185-220
  - Major metro markets (NYC, Boston)
  - Higher demand routes

**Adjustments made for:**
- Market competition (ATL heavily competitive)
- Airport type (NYC airports premium pricing)
- Route popularity (vacation destinations slightly higher)

### Car Rental Pricing:
- **Major metros:** $38-60 (high Turo availability)
- **Mid-size cities:** $40-50 (standard market rates)
- **Expensive markets:** $65-80 (NYC, limited options)

**Based on:**
- Turo typically 30% cheaper than traditional rentals
- Day rental rates (8-10 hours)
- Market-specific availability

### Value Score Calculation:
```
Value Score = 100 √ó (1 - (Cost per Hour / Max Cost per Hour))

Where:
- Cost per Hour = Total Trip Cost / (Ground Time Hours)
- Higher score = Better value
- Range: 0-100
```

**These are ESTIMATES for planning purposes. Real prices vary by date, demand, and availability.**

## üõ† TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### For Local Development:

**Python Packages Needed:**
```bash
pip install requests pandas openpyxl python-dateutil
```

**Optional (for enhanced features):**
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn  # For visualizations
pip install schedule  # For automated price monitoring
pip install sqlite3  # For price history database
```

### API Rate Limits:
- **Amadeus Free Tier:** 2,000 API calls/month

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:

**API Authentication Fails:**
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check you're using test.api.amadeus.com (not production)
- Ensure access token is being refreshed

**No Flights Found:**
- Search dates must be 1+ days in future
- Some routes may not have early morning/evening flights
- Try expanding time windows slightly

**Rate Limit Exceeded:**
- Implement caching
- Batch requests
- Add delays between calls
- Consider upgrading to paid tier if needed
